## Upcoming Events

There are currently no events scheduled for Baltimore Code & Coffee.

Interested in facilitating an event? Check out the [process to submit one](#process-to-submit-an-event).

## Facilitate an Event
Great! In order to keep track of events (potential, upcoming, and past), we want

### Process to Submit an Event
1. Fill out an [Issue](https://github.com/BmoreCodeCoffee/events/issues/new/choose) for the kind of event you're interested in hosting during a Code and Coffee. If you're not sure what kind of an event you want to host, look below at [Types of Events]((#types-of-events)).
2. Once it's submitted, an organizer will review the submission. They will reach out with questions (if any) and to confirm a date. They may ask clarifying questions to make sure we can accommodate your event and we can make sure to include it in our next meet up event page.
3. Once a date is agreed upon, we'll put your event on our calendar and including in the meet up event!

## Types of Events

### Talk
A talk is a person or group presenting about a specific topic or subject. It can include a demonstration, but generally doesn't have a lot of audience participation outside of answering questions or inciting a discussion. This is also a good option if you want to practice a talk for a conference.

If you are interested giving a **talk**, fill out a [talk issue](https://github.com/BmoreCodeCoffee/events/issues/new?assignees=&labels=talk&template=talk.md&title=%3Aspeech_balloon%3A+%5BTITLE+OF+YOUR+PRESENTATION+HERE%5D).

### Workshop
Like a talk, this is usually lead by a person or a group on a specific topic but also leads the audience in one or more exercises. In the past, we've had workshops on docker, introduction to python, etc.

If you are interested in hosting a **workshop**, fillout a [workshop issue](https://github.com/BmoreCodeCoffee/events/issues/new?assignees=&labels=workshop&template=workshop.md&title=%3Atelescope%3A+%5BTITLE+OF+YOUR+WORKSHOP+HERE%5D)

### Lightning Talk
About once a quarter, we like to host a space for lightning talks. These are usually 10 minute talks people have prepared (or not) about a specific topic. The purpose of these could be informative, sharing about a personal project or issue, etc. If you are interested in participating in our next Lightning Talk event, submit one a [lightning talk issue](https://github.com/BmoreCodeCoffee/events/issues/new?assignees=&labels=lightning&template=lightning_talk.md&title=%3Azap%3A+%5BTITLE+OF+YOUR+TALK+HERE%5D)

### Event
This is more general than the first two options. Do you want to host a mini-hackathon? Or your event isn't _quite_ described in the descriptions abve? Fill out an [event issue](https://github.com/BmoreCodeCoffee/events/issues/new?assignees=&labels=event&template=event.md&title=%3Acalendar%3A+%5BTITLE+OF+YOUR+EVENT+HERE%5D).

## FAQs
### Q: Can I just show up and present something?
**A:** Maybe? But we can't guarantee space. Some of the reasons why we use this [issue submission system](https://github.com/BmoreCodeCoffee/events/issues/new/choose) are:
- We want to make sure we have the space to accomodate our normal operations in addition to presentations.
- We don't want to double book presentations/events so people don't have to pick which one(s) to go to.
- We want to give attendees a heads up in case those interested can make more of an effort to attend.

### Q: Is there a reason why an event may get denied?
**A:** Only if we feel that the event is inappropriate for our event.

### Q: I want to host an event not at Code and Coffee/longer than Code and Coffee hours. What should I do?
Unfortunately we cannot host an event not during a Code and Coffee event. We reserve our space for the times scheduled.
