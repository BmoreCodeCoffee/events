This repo helps us organize and schedule upcoming events including workshops, presentations, hack-a-thons, lightning talks and more.

## Facilitate an Event
Great! In order to keep track of events (potential, upcoming, and past), we want

### Types of Events:

**Talk:** A talk is a person or group presenting about a specific topic or subject. It can include a demonstration, but generally doesn't have a lot of audience participation outside of answering questions or inciting a discussion. This is also a good option if you want to practice a talk for a conference.

If you are interested giving a **talk**, fill out a talk issue.

**Workshop:** Like a talk, this is usually lead by a person or a group on a specific topic but also leads the audience in one or more exercises.

**Event:** This is more general than the first two options. Do you want to host a mini-hackathon? Something else, please 

**Lightning Talks:** About once a quarter, we like to host a space for lightning talks. These are usually 10 minute talks people have prepared (or not) about a specific topic. The purpose of these could be informative, sharing about a personal project or issue, etc.
